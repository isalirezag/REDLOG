Reference:
Reduced-Reference Quality Assessment Based on
the Entropy of DWT Coefficients of Locally
Weighted Gradient Magnitudes 2016.

Usage:
--------------------------------------------
Run the Demo to make sure the code get the answer with your system and then you can use REDLOG_Index to compute the quality
Please make sure to clear the paths in your matlab so you do not receive error.

REDLOG_Quality_Score=REDLOG_Index(Org_Img,Dist_Img,ShowImagMap)
Org_Img: Original image
Dist_Img: Distorted image
ShowImagMap: if 1 you would see the normalized map if zero you wont see the map.

To get the results provided in the paper, run TEST_RESULTS_ON_Diff_Datasets.m
